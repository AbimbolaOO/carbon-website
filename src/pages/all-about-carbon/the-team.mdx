<PageDescription>

The Carbon design system is not just the effort of one central team. Carbon is a
community-driven open-source project. To sustain productive contribution, and
maintain a clear direction for Carbon as a whole, there are various groups to
provide governance and support.

## The Carbon team

Blurb and pictures of the Carbon team itself go here.

## Board of directors

### Purpose

The board holds the steering committee, and Carbon as a whole, accountable for
delivery and business impact. They provide the steering committee feedback on
business need, to facilitate a Carbon roadmap that meets those needs.

The board, comprising of executive stakeholders, commits to champion Carbon
adoption and Carbon standards within their organization. They also commit to,
where possible, engaging design or development resources from within their
organization to help accomplish the Carbon roadmap.

The Carbon Design System board of directors receives a quarterly report from the
Carbon Design System steering committee.

## Steering committee

### Purpose

The Carbon Design System steering committee provides oversight and direction for
Carbon, its community, and related projects.

The steering committee:

- Supports strategy, quality, and consistency within the design system
- Promotes and supports usage of and contribution to the Carbon Design System
  within their organizations
- Identifies, and aligns, components/patterns/content that are multi-product, or
  universal usage
- Facilitates consolidation of components and patterns where multiples exist -
  i.e. “pick winners”
- Assesses and votes to approve or deny community proposals (e.g. if a
  particular PAL might warrant the "Carbon for [x]" title, if individuals or
  teams can be given _committer_ rights to all or part of the Carbon codebase)
- Approves the creation of project teams or expert groups, and their scope of
  committed work
- Support guilds and projects teams by recommending members who can contribute
- Assist with standardizing information and tooling to support sharing across
  teams and business units
- Provides a quarterly update to the Board of Directors

The steering committee agrees that their decisions will be taken by a vote. A
"yes" == +1 vote, "abstain" == 0 vote, "no" == -1 vote. A proposal needs +3
total votes for approval.

The steering committee meets every two weeks.

Expert teams are permanent or semi-permanent groups of subject matter experts.
They can be formed from scratch, or might leverage an existing guild or work
group.

Project teams are formed to work on specific community initiatives, with a clear

Proposals for the formation of expert or project teams are submitted to the
steering committee for approval.
